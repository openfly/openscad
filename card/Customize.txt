== Make your own font ==

* Import into Linux (otf seemed to work)
* Using Inkscape, save individual letters off to .eps.  Use my naming scheme to minimize effort to rename files.
* Convert to dxf using the following command:
for file in $(ls *eps); do filename=$(echo $file | sed 's/\(.\).eps/\1/'); echo;  pstoedit -dt -f dxf:-polyaslines $filename.eps $filename.dxf; done
* Move files into seperate directory, example:
mv *dxf ../fnt-LeagueGothic
* Open OpenSCADFont, and adjust fnt_directory variable



Other Notes

For creating a bulk of the elseif statement within the directory, some command-line magic:

for file in $(ls *dxf); do filename=$(echo $file | sed 's/\(.\).dxf/\1/'); echo "  } else if (char == \"$filename\") {"; echo "    scale([scale_x,scale_y,0]) linear_extrude(file=str(fnt_directory,\"$filename.dxf\"),height=height, convexity=10);"; done > ../LeagueGothic.code

You shouldn't have to run this command, unless you want to adjust the naming convention extensively.
